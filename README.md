## Brief Introduction
A small R-based tool for quickly appending multiple excel data tables into one sprredsheet. Currently code works on csv files, but with a slight modification of the command the tool can also be applied to xlsx files, etc.

The tool was originally written to facilitate the work of my girlfriend, but anyone is welcome to use or modify it. 

## Install
To be added.

## Usage
Due to data privacy policy issues, it is not possible to show the original data in use at this time. However, after a series of tests, this initial version appears to have been able to accomplish its goal. The test date was 31th August 2021. Demonstrating usage in detail using some dummy data is under consideration  if needed.
